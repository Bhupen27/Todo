To run the code first download both the frontend and the backend folder 
then navigate to the backend folder and run the following commands:
-npm/yarn install 
-you will need to add an .env file and add MONGO_URI to be able to connect to the database
-(the mongo URI that I used is :"mongodb+srv://bhupenkhadka27:bhupenkhadka27@cluster0.ninpg.mongodb.net/ToDoApp?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0")
-npm/yarn start

now coming to the frontend part firstly navigate to the frontend folder and run the following commands:
-npm/yarn install
-npm/yarn run dev
